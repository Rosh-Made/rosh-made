Welcome to Roshmade

\
What is Roshmade? My life in a blog? Or is it more to that?

One of the many reasons I started this blog is to bring awareness of the ongoing climate issues and document my journey to mindful living while enjoying life. I want to use this platform to promote sustainable ways of living, share simple but practical solutions, rethink and reduce the impact on a dying planet, and be a place to inspire others and to be inspired.


While that’s on a serious note, I also want to use this space to celebrate creativity and share some amazing + fun content in home design, DIYs projects, home gardening, spontaneous travel guides, home cooking, and many more. 

I’m a big admirer of knowledge sharing, I want to make this space to share ideas, knowledge, and create a positive community. Being able to inspire and encourage someone through writing is a wholesome feeling, and when people respond to you in positive ways it makes it even better and I feel like I want to do more. 


Watch out for this space!

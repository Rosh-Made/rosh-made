Nothing beats the satisfaction of ‘growing your own food', having total control over what goes into the production, and knowing where it's coming from is the best feeling. To have my own kitchen garden is something that I always dreamed of, and I can’t believe I’m writing a blog on this, someone please pinch me!

So, two months ago, my partner - Shanika, and I decided to finally tackle our messy, boring, and unattractive backyard and give some life to it. Another fun project we did during the lockdown and sharing our experience of how we transformed a shabby backyard into something beautiful but also functional. 

Important notes:

* We do not have a big piece of land, but I always believe that what you have is more than enough to start with and make it to use. 
* As a novice gardener, I had to do a lot of homework and learn along the way, and of course lots of trial and error. 

 It took us nearly two months to plan + implement what we have today, here’s my personal step-by-step approach. 

1. Do your homework, **PLAN**, yes in big letters!

~ Location \
Plants need at least 6-8 hours of sun throughout the day, therefore it’s crucial to choose the ideal location when planning/designing your vegetable plot. Since our backyard is east-facing, we get good morning sunlight and shade in the evening, just ideal for the veggies. 

~ Garden beds ideas \
As much as I want our plot to be functional, I’d also want to make sure it’s an inviting place to work. For that reason, we went with the wooden raised bed which is just perfect for a small urban garden: easier to maintain, and adds beauty at the same time. \
But of course, there are other alternatives such as cement blocks, bricks, steel containers, and many more. Internet and Pinterest is your best friend if you want to brainstorm [some ideas](https://www.familyfoodgarden.com/vegetable-garden-ideas/).

~ Garden Layout \
Layering out the garden is important so that you can decide the spacing and materials required. My partner found this sophisticated tool called [Sketchup](https://www.sketchup.com/) (FREE!) to sketch our garden plan out. It’s a 3D design software where you can pretty much model anything with the exact measurements, to say the least, it turned out exactly how we designed.
In the plan, we were able to fit four different sizes of raised beds given the size of our growing area. It’s your call to decide the bedding size but the recommended size should not exceed these lengths. 

~ Crop Selection \
The second most important factor is what you want to grow. You want to grow what you would eat right? And not everything you’re going to like can grow easily. As I’m a novice to veggie gardening, I started with a few easy ones and then build up as I as go along.

~ Crop Layout \
Laying out your veggies is crucial just as the location you choose to grow. Just like humans, we don’t want toxic people around us, same concept applies to plants, for a better crop yield they need to have their best companions together. I found this lifesaver tool: [GARDEN PLANNER](https://gardenplanner.almanac.com/) that helps you to plan the best layout for your space and tells you what veggies, herbs, and flowers work well together, how many plants will fit into a space, and a lot more. 

Here's what I've grown in my four beds. 

| Bed 1        | Bed 2    | Bed 3         | Bed 4    |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Sunflower    | Capsicum | Tomatoes      | Cabbage  |
| Sweet Corn   | Cucumber | Basil         | Kale     |
| Squash       | Beans    | Lettuce       | Broccoli |
| Strawberries | Cilantro | Spring Onions |          |

* I’ve incorporated Nasturtium and Marigold into each bed, not only do they add aesthetics but a natural pest control for aphids, beetles, and whitefly.
* I've also reserved an area for the flower border, to grow some bee-friendly flowers to attract pollinators for pollination and for a better crop yield, a key element to a veggie garden!



2. Clean + Prepare the area 

Our back garden was just in a bad state, it has been neglected for good 3 years by the previous owners, and from us. I hope this picture speaks, Am I embarrassed? Maybe. 



We had to do a massive cleanup and get rid of the junk. The house came with a huge garden shed, which we gave to one of the guys who collect metals, and we arrange a garden waste collection from SKIP bins for the rest of the waste which I believe was a cost-effective option.  

Before you start laying the beds, make sure the ground is level, in our case we had to separate and level up the area since our land is sitting on a slope. 

Something to remember, labour in NZ is just crazy expensive, so my suggestion is to do as much as you can like tidying up and DIYs and let the rest handle by the professionals.

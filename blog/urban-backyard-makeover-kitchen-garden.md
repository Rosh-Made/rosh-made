Nothing beats the satisfaction of ‘growing your own food', having total control over what goes into the production, and knowing where it's coming from is the best feeling. To have my own kitchen garden is something that I always dreamed of, and I can’t believe I’m writing a blog on this, someone please pinch me!

So, two months ago, my partner - Shanika, and I decided to finally tackle our messy, boring, and unattractive backyard and give some life to it. Another fun project we did during the lockdown and sharing our experience of how we transformed a shabby backyard into something beautiful but also functional. 

Important notes:

* We do not have a big piece of land, but I always believe that what you have is more than enough to start with and make it to use. 

* As a novice gardener, I had to do a lot of homework and learn along the way and of course lots of trial and error. 

 It took us nearly two months to plan + implement what we have today, here’s my step-by-step approach.

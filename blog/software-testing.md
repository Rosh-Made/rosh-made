Switching to a career in IT from a non-IT background seems as daunting as it sounds but when I think about it now I feel like that was the best investment (time + money) and decision I made 3 years ago in my life. 

I'm often asked WHY, WHAT, and HOW I made this career move and hence I collate this blog to share my journey and help/guide someone to reach their career goals. So, If you're someone thinking of moving to Software Testing from a non-IT field, or someone new to the local job market (Immigrant to NZ), or a recent graduate, I hope your questions will be answered at the end of this blog with some important tips and guides. 

### My journey

To give a little context, I moved to New Zealand 10 years ago and completed my studies in Business Management at the age of 23. I worked as an Office Administrator full-time for a year or more, later on, I realized that I wasn't enjoying it and was capable of doing something more and better. 

Shanika, my partner who is a Software Developer, one day suggested that I should try something in the IT field. Back then I thought IT is solemnly coding, which I was not too interested in. The turning point for me was when he said IT has many different roles that do not need in-depth knowledge of coding or technicality. Since I've already had a Business Management diploma, a few of the roles that he mentioned sort of resonated with my personality and skills (Which were *Business Analyst, Software Tester, Project Manager, Scrum Master, UI/UX Design* roles). I've started to do some research in the IT market, spoke to people who are in the software industry, and continue to look into IT-related studies. 

Early 2018, I've completed my bachelor's in Information Systems thinking that I could either follow the path as a Software Tester aka QA - Quality Assurance or as a BA - Business Analyst. Little did I know how competitive and difficult the job market was for fresh graduates to enter. As soon as I completed my studies, I've applied for a couple of *Internships* since we were not offered that option at my university. I got offered an Internship at Sky TV in the Product and Technology Department, which was pretty much the initial introduction to the real IT world and the first step in the testing career. I would say I had a little bit of advantage as my partner knew quite a few people in the software industry, *NETWORKS* do matter at this stage! 

After completing the internship, I knew I had to stand out in the market. I've worked on a couple of start-up projects as a Manual Tester. In the meantime, I've studied and gained the *ISTQB certification* (foundation level) in Software Testing. I've also noticed that there was hype and demand for *Automation Software Testers* and I knew that Manual Testing is not going to be sufficient. 

Later that year I found something interesting, a ***job-ready training program*** for fresh IT graduates, a place where you can train for in-demand/essential technical skills (Automation Testing), gain hands-on experience in real projects in an agile environment, build up soft skills that companies are seeking. It is a 3 monthly paid program, if you're interested let me know, I prefer not to disclose the business name here as it might NOT be the only option and it's a bit of money. But to say the least, it was a great investment since you can recover the cost in a month when you start to work. 

After completing the job-ready program, that is exactly 4 months later (in the midst of 2019) I was able to land my *first job* as a Software Tester. Honestly a proud moment! 

This is my journey, it wasn't an easy ride but I never gave up, I knew I was going to make it at some stage. Here’s what I did extra for a smooth career switch. 

• Tailor your CV/Resume to IT

CV is the first impression and is what represents you. It’s a great way to showcase your technical skills, what you have been learning and what you’re capable of, so make the most out of it.  For example, I’ve linked these in my CV

~ Technical blog: If you don’t have a technical blog, start creating one and write blogs about what you learn. Here's [mine](https://maryannroshani.home.blog/). 

~ Demo Projects: I've done a few demo projects and uploaded them on GitHub and linked them in the CV.

~ Obtained an I[STQB certification](https://www.istqb.org/certification-path-root/why-istqb-certification.html): This qualification will make a world of difference on the resume.

~ Volunteered for a start-up business as a manual tester to get hands-on experience and add it to the resume. Local experience is a MUST in a CV. \
\
Important: Don’t FORGET to get your resume reviewed by the professionals.

• Network 

~ Keep LinkedIn Profile up to date: Introduce yourself to hiring managers, it’s a powerful digital networking tool! I almost get messages every 2 months from a recruiter.

~ Attended Software Testing related [Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/topics/software-qa-and-testing/nz/) and Conferences
An opportunity to introduce yourself and meet IT Professionals. Funny Story, 3 years ago I went for a meetup, was intrigued by this significant individual, last year I got to work with him on a recent project. It’s amazing how things work!

• Prepare for Interviews

~ Interviews can be quite stressful, I've collated interview questions and practiced how to answer them eloquently and confidently, so when there’s an interview I just refer to that. 

~ Many of the companies require you to do Psychometric and Aptitude tests. They are free and also have paid tests online. 

~ I Attended interviews as much as I can, even though I was been rejected a few times. Take it as an opportunity, you can learn how to face an interview, what are frequently asked questions, and how to be more confident. 

• Signed up for [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?src=ukw&q=java+courses+for+testers) to learn a programming language, in my case I chose Java specifically for testers

• Followed testing blogs and podcasts to keep an eye on testing trends 

Changing careers is overwhelming, takes a lot of preparation, practice, and time. But be patient, and stay persistent. Set up specific goals and do your best to achieve them on a set timeline. \
For example, Write down what you achieved each month (Objectives), every little milestone is important and shows how far you have come in your journey and shows how close you are to reaching your goal/goals.

| Month    | Objectives                                               |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| May 2018 | \- Passed ISTQB Exam                                     |
| May 2018 | \- Participated in Test Automation and Digital QA Summit |
| May 2018 | \- Volunteered for a start-up as a Manual Tester         |

Technical Skills

I've shortlisted a skillset for Beginner Software Tester, this is pretty much what I worked on, and for each skill, let's say Manual Testing, I've listed down what areas to focus on and how to do it.

 I've created a ***My Career Journey*** document including all the above, let me know if you're interested, happy to share. It's a well-organized document that I've passed down to a lot of people who are new to Software Testing and these are the contents that I've included.

My last bit of advice :) 

• Believe in yourself and Never GIVE UP!

• Everyone’s journey is different, don’t compare with others but get INSPIRED!

• HELP everyone and SHARE KNOWLEDGE, a very powerful tool. It’s a Win/Win

I wish you the best of luck in job hunting/career change and am always happy to answer your questions. Please share this blog if you know anyone in need. Thank you!

A day in the life of a Software Tester

Let me give a little dose of our day-to-day lives as a Software Tester.

Before we get into it, let me explain what is ***Software Testing*** in simple. \
\
It is the process of *validating or checking for any bugs or errors of a Software Application* that Developers have been working on. Our primary focus or intent is to make sure the final software that hits the market is glitch-free and the software is working as expected. 

Now let's get into detail about what does a Software Tester do on a daily basis 

~ Most obvious and primary responsibility is Testing: validating a feature/functionality from the development team and executing all the possible test scenarios. If there's any bug/glitch, it's the Testers' responsibility to track it and make sure the bug is fixed by the correspondent developer and is re-tested again by the tester!

~ Coordination and Clear communication 

* Developers: \
  As I mentioned above, it's the Testers' responsibility to make sure the bug you identify is tracked and get it fixed by the developer. Therefore it's important to have good coordination and clear communication with developers in order to build and maintain a good relationship. 
* Business Analysts: \
  Plays a key role in a Software/Agile team. If you think the Acceptance criteria of a feature/function is not defined correctly, the first person I would go to is the Business Analyst aka BA. As a Tester, it is important to understand all the Acceptance criteria of a feature. 
* Business Users (Real users): \
  The main goal of a software project (I would say any Project) is to satisfy the customer's needs that is completing the project to their agreed requirements. Therefore, it is important to communicate with customers what the team has been working on to get continuous feedback. As a Tester, we have to do demos at the end of every sprint, so it's vital that Demos are being delivered clearly.

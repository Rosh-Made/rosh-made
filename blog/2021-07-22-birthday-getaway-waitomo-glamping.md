If you're a nature-lover at heart and enjoy camping but want to treat yourself a little extra on your special day, then glamping is your luxury medium.\
\
The concept of *Glamping* is a fusion of glamor + camping where stunning nature meets modern luxury. Once in a while, it's nice to go somewhere hassle-free without having to think of packing, or setting up your camp, 

If you're looking for a unique hideaway to unwind and unplug from the world, enjoy breathtaking panoramic views and experience the peaceful New Zealand Countryside, then Waitomo Hilltop Glamping is the SPOT! 

We are so pleased we picked the right spot for our first-ever glamping experience. Everything was magical and beyond what we imagined. Here are some highlights & tips for our stay.

I'm a flower girl, they make me the happiest, are we related already? ;) 

I buy fresh cut flowers every month mostly during Spring/Summer. But boy oh boy they can be crazy expensive. Statice, Sunflowers, Eucalyptus (foliage) are a few of my favorites but in that naughty expensive list. If I'm not wrong 10 stems of statice are 40 bucks (NZ). Say what! 

This was one of the primary reasons that I started growing plants at home. 

I started with Statice, a year later, now I have this beautiful bunch of statice sitting in the entranceway, which make me realize that I could literally grow anything and that's when my passion for plants begun. 

Reasons to start with statice

~ Ideal for beginners: Possibly the Easiest plant to start with if you're a beginner to gardening (low maintenance) 

~ Excellent for fresh cut flowers: paper textured and a great filler for a vase 

~ Dried arragnements: They preserved so well, it's a perfect mix for drying as the colors dry true to their live colors. 

Steps to grow 

1. First things first: Buy seeds and good a seed raising mix from your local garden shop. 
2. Start sowing seeds at least 6mm depth in trays or pots and place it indoors, hint: *Please follow the instructions in the the seed package*
3. Make sure you keep the soil moist. Don't over water! 
4. Allow the seedlings to grow at least 5cm before transplanting. Meanwhile prepare a garden bed that receives full sun. 
5. When transplanting, ensure seedlings are well spaced at least 30-40cm apart. 
6. Water twice a week during the early stage, and then reduce gradually. To be honest I never watered them when it stared flowering.

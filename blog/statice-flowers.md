I'm a flower girl, they make me the happiest, are we related already? ;)

I buy fresh cut flowers every month mostly during Spring/Summer. But boy oh boy they can be crazy expensive. Statice, Sunflowers, Baby breath, Eucalyptus (foliage) are a few of my favorites but in that naughty expensive list. If I'm not wrong 10 stems of statice are 40 bucks (NZ). Say what!

This was one of the primary reasons that I started growing plants at home. 
I started with Statice, a year later, now I have this beautiful bunch of dried statice sitting in the entranceway, which make me realize that I could possibly grow anything and that's when my passion for plants begun.

Reasons to start with Statice

~ Ideal for beginners: possibly the easiest plant to start with if you're a beginner at gardening 

~ Excellent for fresh cut flowers: they come in a palette of colors which is a great filler for vases and arrangements 

~ Beautiful for dried arrangements: they preserved so well, a perfect mix for drying as the colors dry true to their live colors. They look almost as beautiful dry as they do fresh, making a crafts favorite ;)

Steps to grow 

1. First things first: Buy seeds and a good seed-raising mix from your local garden shop. 
2. Start sowing seeds at least 6mm depth in trays or pots and place them indoors.
   Hint: Best time to sow is few weeks before the frost year. Just follow the instructions in the seed package :)
3. Make sure you keep the soil moist but please Do not overwater! 
4. Allow the seedlings to grow at least 5cm before transplanting. Meanwhile, prepare a garden bed that receives full sun and has average soil. 
5. When transplanting, ensure seedlings are well spaced at least 30-40cm apart. 
6. Water twice a week during the early stage, and then reduce gradually. To be honest I never watered them when they started flowering. 
7. Statice grows fairly quickly, it produces blooms within 8 - 10 weeks after planting out into the garden
8. Harvest statice when the blooms are fully open - that is when the white petals are visible, if they are harvested before they are immature, they are more at risk for wilting.

Growing tips

* To preserve the color of statice, hang to dry upside down in a well-aired indoor position
* The most common problem for statice is related to overwatering, they do not need much water hence its drought tolerant. Statice is hardy and disease and bug resistant, therefore it's really low Maintenance!
* keep the leftover seeds in a cool place for better germination for next time, I store mine in the fridge :)

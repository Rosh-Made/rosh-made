I'm a flower girl, they make me the happiest, are we related already? ;) 

I buy fresh cut flowers every month mostly during Spring/Summer. But boy oh boy they can be crazy expensive. Statice, Sunflowers, Eucalyptus (foliage) are a few of my favorites but in that naughty expensive list. If not mistaken 10 stems of statice is 40 bucks (NZ). Say what! 

This was one of the primary reasons that I started growing plants at home. 

I started with Statice, a year later, now I have this beautiful bunch of statice sitting in the entranceway, which make me realize that I could literally grow anything and that's when my passion for plants begun. 

Statice is one the easiest plant for a beginner, honestly it's super easy to care for and has low maintenance. 

, they preserved so well, it's a perfect mix for drying as the colors dry true to their live colors.

What’s come to your mind when you think about flowers, plants, and trees?

Yes, they are beautiful, delicate, bring a splash of colors to the garden.

But hey! there's more than that. They also play a vital role in the functioning of our ecosystems. This is especially true in the case of pollinators. In Simple, the functioning of our ecosystem rests on the tiny backs of these pollinators – a big burden for their little shoulders to bear!

Here's to refresh your memory from science class: \
These amazing tiny creatures move from plant to plant for food: i.e nectar, as they move, they transfer pollen from a male part of a plant to a female part of a plant, later enabling fertilization and allowing it to reproduce and form seeds, berries, fruits. 

Unfortunately, pollinators are in trouble and are dropping at a terrifying rate worldwide, pesticides are largely to blame. The aim of this blog is to raise awareness of these little workers who are so essential for our natural world. If there's anything we can give them a helping hand with, we definitely should! 

Here are a few simplest things that you could do.

~ Become a backyard *wildlife* gardener:

All you need to do is grow plants that attract and help pollinators, here are my top bee-friendly plants that are easy to grow and must-have in a bee-friendly garden.  \
\
Flowers: Cornflower, Sunflower, Dahlia, Daisy, Marigold\
Herbs: Lavender, Borage, Thyme, Sage, Fennel, Rosemary, Salvia \
Natives: Pohutukawa, Rata\
Shrubs: Swan Plant, Hibiscus, Hydrangeas, Citrus

Hints: 

* You don’t need a big backyard, what you have is more than enough :)
* I’d suggest you buy seedlings if you’re a beginner but also you can try sowing seeds which I'm doing. 
* You don’t have to start big, just start with a couple, and see how it goes. This is my second year planting, so I’m going big this time ;) 
* I've had a few failures last year with seedlings, so expect that. Make sure you follow instructions!
* They need water just like other species, so don't forget to keep water for them.

Gardening is a great therapy; it really does rejuvenate your soul. Nothing makes me happier than being in the garden, watching something grow from nothing, seeing the beautiful pollinators, and relishing the great outdoors. 

Go and make a difference for wildlife like pollinators and let's make the most of the time we have with this lockdown. Happy Gardening!

Here's a video that explains the importance of pollination and what would happen if the pollinators go extinct  - specifically Bees.

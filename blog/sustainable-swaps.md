Let’s talk about an issue that we hear on a daily basis and we consume on guilt.

Yes, plastics! It has become so central to our everyday life, more frightening, by 2050 it's estimated that there could be more plastic in the ocean than fish by weight. Let that sink IN!

The mid last year 2020, while I was home during the lockdown, I promised myself that I’m going to use that extra time to research and reduce waste generated at home. 

The first thing that came to my mind was the KITCHEN, where a lot of waste happens be it plastic bottles, disposable, food waste, toxic chemicals, and the list goes on.  Something that really bothered me was having to buy cleaning products (Dishwash, Handwash, clean spray) in plastic bottles every time they ran over. 

I started to look for sustainable alternatives online, few options popped up.  I went for [The Honest Eco](https://www.thehonesteco.nz/shop) and 7 reasons why:

~ They are partners with well-known Eco-friendly kiwi brands: [Eco store](https://ecostore.com/nz/) + [Earthwise](https://earthwise.co.nz/) 

~ Have a few Package options, I've got the Complete Kitchen package (unfortunately the [package specials](https://www.thehonesteco.nz/packages) is not available at the moment)

1 x Dishwashing Liquid 5L\
1 x Multi-Purpose Cleaner 5L\
1 x The Honest Eco Dish Washing Liquid Glass bottle\
1 x The Honest Eco All-Purpose Glass bottle

~ First and foremost, it does the purpose, cuts down on packaging that significantly helps to reduce plastic in your household. \
[The Honest Eco](https://www.thehonesteco.nz/shop) has their own refill service where you can send your 5L container to refill or else you can take that to your nearest [Refill Nation Station by Eco Store](https://ecostore.com/nz/storelocator/refill/) to fill up meaning you never have to buy new plastic bottles again. How incredible is this concept of refilling? LOVE IT!

~ Cruelty-free and approved ingredients \
\
~ And of course, aesthetically pleasing, functional & sustainable refillable [Glass bottles](https://www.thehonesteco.nz/bottles) with labels on your preference. 

Other Options:

~[ Eco Store](https://ecostore.com/nz/) has few [package options](https://ecostore.com/nz/shop/household/packs/) for Home/Cleaning care or else you can take your own containers or jars and they will refill it for you.

~ [Dazz NZ](https://dazz.co.nz/) is another great option, which I found out only recently. Their concept is simple, turning cleaning tablets + Water into your household cleaning spray! 

Reducing our plastic use is critical and will require determined social and behavioral shifts. But the good news is that even the smallest switches can make a positive impact. Be the part to reduce plastic pollution and conserve resources. REMEMBER every effort counts and do it for you, your family, and our planet and bring awareness to people around you.

Thank you for taking your precious time to read and I hope you enjoyed my very FIRST blog. I'm going to be covering more on kitchen sustainable swaps on another blog, stay tuned! Meanwhile, make a little effort, do a little research on Refill stations in your area, and start making a difference. Planet Earth will thank you!

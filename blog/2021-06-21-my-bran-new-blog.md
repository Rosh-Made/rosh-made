PROBLEM:

Let’s talk about an issue that we hear on a daily basis and we use willingly or unwillingly.

Yes, plastics! It has become so central to our everyday life, more frightening, by 2050 it's estimated that there could be more plastic in the ocean than fish. Let that sink IN!
The mid last year 2020, while we were home during the lockdown, I promised myself that I’m going to use that extra time to research and reduce waste generated at home. The first thing that came to my mind was the KITCHEN, where a lot of waste happens be it plastic bottles, disposable, food waste, toxic chemicals, and the list goes on.  Something that really bothered me was having to buy cleaning products (Dish wash, Hand wash, clean spray) in plastic bottles every time they ran over. 

I started to look for some sustainable alternatives online and few options popped up.  I went for [The Honest Eco](https://www.thehonesteco.nz/shop) and reasons:

~ First and foremost, it does the purpose, cuts down on packaging that significantly helps to reduce plastic in your household

~ They are partnered with [Eco store](https://ecostore.com/nz/) + [Earthwise](https://earthwise.co.nz/) brands

~ Has few Packages options, I've got the Complete Kitchen package (unfortunately this package specials is not available)

o	1 x Dish Washing Liquid 5L

o	1 x Multi-Purpose Cleaner 5L

o	1 x The Honest Eco Dish Washing Liquid bottle

o	1 x The Honest Eco All Purpose bottle

\*Handwash wasn’t included in this package which I had to buy it separately

~ This is what I love about this: The Honest Eco offers refills or else you can visit any [Refill nation stores by Eco Store ](https://ecostore.com/nz/storelocator/refill/)closer to you which means you don’t have to buy plastics bottles again. WOW!

~ Comes in bulk size 5L, which means its ideal for big household

~ Cruelty-free and approved ingredients 

~ And of course, aesthetically pleasing, beautiful, functional & sustainable [Glass bottles](https://www.thehonesteco.nz/bottles) with labels on your preference.

Reducing our plastic use is critical and will require determined social and behavioral shifts. But the good news is that even the smallest switches can make a positive impact.

Please don’t forget to share this with your family and friends. Be the part to reduce plastic pollution and conserve resources. REMEMBER every effort counts and do it for you, your family, and your community. 

“You cannot get through a single day without having an impact on the world around you. What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of a difference you want to make.”

A Garden Retrospective 

Well, I know I’m long overdue for a blog, But hey! better late than never. But honestly, I had the best summer this year, one of them has been learning how to grow food and flowers in our little urban backyard.  

As I promised in my previous blog [Urban Backyard Makeover](https://www.roshmade.com/urban-backyard-makeover-kitchen-garden/), this blog is about my summer harvest, more like a garden retrospection: the plants that thrived, the failures, and the learnings. As a beginner gardener, this has been a rewarding and fun project I've ever done. Here’s my honest review, Enjoy!

The successes 

* First and foremost, a big bonus for adding a flower border, an essential for a veggie patch! It attracted so many pollinators aka *increased pollination* that I believe it resulted in a better crop turnover. Check out my blog on how to [attract pollinators.](https://www.roshmade.com/save-the-pollinators/)

  Another great advantage is that you can pick your own flowers :)

* Greens are a staple in our household, we had a lot of fresh summer salads this year. The lettuce, the cucumbers, and the herbs were bountiful. For good 3 months we didn’t have to buy any greens from the store, how awesome is that!

* What would a summer garden be without tomatoes? another huge success in my garden. I had two types: beefsteak and cherry tomatoes, to be honest, we had more than what we needed but I’m happy I made them into good use, for salads, sauces, and soups. I’ve planted tomatoes among other companion plants such as marigold, and basil and they really thrived and tasted even better.
* Honestly, I was surprised to see how successful my corn crop was despite the little space I have, they were super delicious! 
* One must have in their garden: Gotukola. It’s a SUPERFOOD! one power-packed herb. I remember growing up I would have Gotukola at least once a week in my household back in Sri Lanka.  This green is so versatile, that you can consume in so many ways: morning porridge, salads, smoothies, etc. I guess it’s one of the most underrated greens on the other side of the world. Something to remember though, Gotukola is invasive, so make sure that you plant in a covered area. 
*  No slugs! Wow, a gardener’s dream aye!

A Garden Retrospective 

Well, I know I’m long overdue for a blog, But hey! better late than never. But honestly, I had the best summer this year, one of them has been learning how to grow food and flowers in our little urban backyard.  

As I promised in my previous blog [Urban Backyard Makeover](https://www.roshmade.com/urban-backyard-makeover-kitchen-garden/), this blog is all about my summer harvest, more like a garden retrospect: the plants that thrived, the failures, the learnings. As a beginner gardener, this has been one of the most rewarding and fun projects I've ever done. Here’s my honest review, Enjoy!

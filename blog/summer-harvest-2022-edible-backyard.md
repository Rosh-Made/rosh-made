### A Garden Retrospective

Well, I know I’m long overdue for a blog, But hey! better late than never. But honestly, I had the best summer this year, one of them has been learning how to grow food and flowers in our little urban backyard.  

As I promised in my previous blog [Urban Backyard Makeover](https://www.roshmade.com/urban-backyard-makeover-kitchen-garden/), this blog is going to be about my first summer harvest experience, more like a garden retrospect: the plants that thrived, the failures, and the learnings. As a beginner gardener, this has been an enjoyable and rewarding project. Here’s my honest review, Enjoy!

### The successes

* First and foremost, a big bonus for adding a flower border, an essential for a veggie patch! It attracted so many pollinators *(i.e increased pollination)* that I believe it resulted in a better crop turnover. Check out my blog on how to [attract pollinators.](https://www.roshmade.com/save-the-pollinators/)

* Another perk of having a flower border is that you can pick flowers to fill the house ;) How gorgeous is this flower display?

* Greens are a staple in our household, we had a lot of fresh summer salads in fact we didn't have to buy any from the local market for the whole summer. The lettuce, the cucumbers, the peppers, and the herbs were bountiful.

* What would a summer garden be without tomatoes? another huge success in my garden. I had two types: beefsteak and cherry tomatoes, to be honest, we had more than what we needed. But I’m glad I made them into good use, for salads, sauces, and soups. I’ve planted tomatoes among other companion plants such as marigold, and basil and they really thrived and the reason it tastes better.

* Honestly, I was surprised to see how successful my corn crop was despite the little space I've grown them and they were super delicious!

* One must have in their garden: Gotukola aka Centella Asiatica, one power-packed herb. Growing up, I remember having Gotukola at least once a week in my household back in Sri Lanka.  This green is so versatile, that you can consume it in so many ways as morning porridge, salads, smoothies, etc. I guess it’s one of the most underrated greens on the other side of the world. Something to remember though, Gotukola is invasive, so make sure that you plant in a covered area.

* Pleased to say they were no slugs in our veggie plot, Wow, a gardener’s dream aye! I think a few reasons have been that the gravel footpath and all the raised beds were taped from copper slug tape. 

### The Failures

* Out of the 15 veggies, Carrots and beetroots were the only two that failed miserably. I think from the research I did, they don’t do well if we transplant, I feel like direct sowing is the best way for root veggies.
* Harvesting right time - Pick beans before the pods turn lumpy and stringy.
* Nasturtium overgrew in one of my raised beds, think I’m going to plant them in a separate pot to maximize the space I have. 

### Lessons Learned

* Was struggling to keep brassica’s veggies from cabbage worms. Solution: I’ve covered the whole bed with a net mesh since it doesn’t need pollination, it worked wonders. But I’d also suggest planting them in winter as there are fewer cabbage worms during the cold months.
* Not sure if want to grow Squash/Pumpkin again, first it took over the whole bed and I’m not a big fan of pumpkin to be honest, sorry pumpkin lovers! but again I like it attracted so many pollinators, so on the fence on this one. 
* Trust me one tomato plant is plenty, I had two, and they got too big and again!  took over the whole bed. 
* Staking and Spacing are essential for vigorous vines. I think when I grew cucumber, I did think it needed a strong support frame and so much space. If I had both done right, I believe I would have gotten a better crop. But trust me I had about 10 giant cucumbers, so I’m not complaining. 
* When you harvest veggies, as a rule of thumb make sure you cut them rather than pulling them off to avoid disease entering the plants, make sure whatever tool you use to cut is clean!
* I’ve also learned that for a small garden space like mine, it's ideal to plant high production crops that give heavy harvest to maximize the space you have. Here are some high production crops: tomatoes, dwarf beans, dwarf snap peas, lettuces, and salad greens. 

### Improvements

* Preservation is something I’d like to learn at some point. 
* Adding a compost bin 
* Install an Irrigation system 
* Potatoes, eggplants, and allium family plants (onion, garlic, ginger) are something that I want to learn how to grow next summer. 
* I’m thinking of growing corn and potatoes together, while potatoes grow mostly underground and require very little above-ground surface area, corn is the opposite—it grows tall and has shallow roots. Planting potato plants among your corn stalks will take advantage of their different needs and maximize space in your garden. For a space like us, I think so this makes the best use of available space in the vegetable patch. 

### Thoughtful ideas

* Share some harvest with birdies: in our case, we had so many sunflower seeds and they loved it.
* Share water with little creatures: they will appreciate it on hot summer days.
* Hang a Bee/Pollinator hotel to shelter them: Bees love it
* Share some veggies with family/friends/neighbors: highly recommended 
* Keep a reminder of why gardening is important: a note on my seedbox.
* Again, you don’t need a big land to grow your food, I believe what you have is more than enough.

What’s in my garden currently?

It’s almost winter in New Zealand, and these are some veggies I’m growing this time of the year.

* Leeks, Broccoli, Carrots, Lettuce, and herbs are some great veggies to grow.
* I’ve planted sugar peas two months ago, and I’ve recently harvested some pods. One of the easiest veggies to grow hands down and can’t wait to make soup out of it. Ideal for winter!

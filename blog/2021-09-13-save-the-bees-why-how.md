What’s come to your mind when you think about flowers?

Yes, they are beautiful, delicate, bring a splash of colors to the garden, and perfect for attracting beautiful insects. 

But hey! they also play a vital role in the functioning of our ecosystems. This is especially true in the case of pollinators. In Simple, the functioning of our ecosystem rests on the tiny backs of these pollinators – a big burden for their little shoulders to bear! In fact, we rely on pollinators to help produce as much as one-third of our food. 

So, if there’s anything we can do to give them a helping hand, we definitely should! And trust me when I say, it's not difficult.

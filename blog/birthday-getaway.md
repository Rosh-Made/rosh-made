If you're a nature-lover at heart and enjoy camping but want to treat yourself a little extra on your special day, then glamping is your luxury medium.\
\
By its very name, the concept of *Glamping* is a fusion of glamor + camping where stunning nature meets modern luxury. Once in a while, it's nice to go somewhere (hassle-free) without having to think of packing or setting up your camp.

If you're looking for a unique hideaway to unwind and unplug from the world, enjoy breathtaking panoramic views, and experience the peaceful New Zealand Countryside, then [Waitomo Hilltop Glamping](https://www.waitomoglamping.nz/) is the SPOT! 

Super pleased that we picked the right spot to celebrate my birthday and our first-ever glamping experience. Everything was magical and beyond what we imagined. Here are some highlights & tips for our stay.

~ LOCATION:\
\
This beautiful place is set on a 700-hectare farm on the crest of a hill, around a three-hour drive from South, Auckland (A short drive from the famous Waitomo Caves)

~ INCLUSION: 

* The one I was most excited for: Dual outdoor bathtubs to soak up the sunrise + overlooking hills ;) 
* An ensuite bathroom with flushing toilet, shower & Eco-friendly toiletries
* Queen size super comfy Canopy bed + (2 x small beds for additional guests) I mean common, it's hard to see it getting more lux than this.
* A s'mores kit + Firepit to cozy up on cold nights. Talk about a greater combo!
* Complimentary organic eggs + milk from the farm + a fresh loaf of homemade bread + organic herbs and many more*
* Outdoor kitchen & pizza oven

~WHAT TO BRING:

*  Food - we stuck to charcuterie snacks such as hummus, veggies, cheese & crackers or you can order catering for an additional cost
* Gumboots or walking shoes if you want to do a farm walk

~ TIPS

* No electricity up in the tent, so make sure you charge your devices
* Stargazing opportunities. hint: Grab some beanbags
* Therapeutic massages are available 

~ WHAT TO DO: 

* Marokopa Falls was a lovely stop on our drive around the area, A beautiful waterfall just a 10- minute walk off the road.
* Waitomo Glowworm Caves

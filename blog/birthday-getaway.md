If you're a nature-lover at heart and enjoy camping but want to treat yourself a little extra on your special day, then glamping is your luxury medium.\
\
The concept of *Glamping* is a fusion of glamor + camping where stunning nature meets modern luxury. Once in a while, it's nice to go somewhere hassle-free without having to think of packing or setting up your camp.

If you're looking for a unique hideaway to unwind and unplug from the world, enjoy breathtaking panoramic views, and experience the peaceful New Zealand Countryside, then [Waitomo Hilltop Glamping](https://www.waitomoglamping.nz/) is the SPOT! 

Stay tuned if you want to know what our experience was like and enjoy this small clip of our stay.

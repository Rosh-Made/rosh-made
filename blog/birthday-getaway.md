If you're a nature-lover at heart and enjoy camping but want to treat yourself a little extra on your special day, then glamping is your luxury medium.

By its very name, the concept of *Glamping* is a fusion of glamor + camping where stunning nature meets modern luxury. Once in a while, it's nice to go somewhere (hassle-free) without having to think of packing or setting up your camp.

If you're looking for a unique hideaway to unwind and unplug from the world, enjoy breathtaking panoramic views, and experience the peaceful New Zealand Countryside, then [Waitomo Hilltop Glamping](https://www.waitomoglamping.nz/) is the SPOT! 

Super pleased that we picked the right spot to celebrate my birthday and our first-ever glamping experience. Everything was magical and beyond what we imagined. Here are some highlights & tips for our stay.

~ Only a two and half hour drive from Auckland, this gorgeous place is set on a 700-hectare farm on the crest of a hill with views in every direction. The road to the tent is a little steep wild walk but it's all worth it once you reach the top, trust me!

~ The one I was most excited for and probably the highlight of our stay, dual outdoor bathtubs sitting on the ledge. Talk about bathing with a view and soaking up the sunrise with overlooking fog hills in the morning, Ah, I'll never forget this view. I hope this picture does justice :)

~ This safari tent has all the essentials you need and it's hard to see it getting more lux than this. The tent has a super comfy queen-size bed (also, 2 x small beds for additional guests), an ensuite bathroom with a flushing toilet, shower & eco-friendly toiletries. 

~ Love their outdoor kitchen & pizza oven!
We stayed here for one night, so we brought our own food and stuck to our charcuterie snacks and pizza. But you also have options to cook your own meals or for catering, just let them know beforehand. They complimented us with farm eggs, a fresh loaf of homemade bread, butter, and milk that was way more than enough for our next day breakky.

~ Another highlight of our stay was watching the sunset which was absolutely breathtaking and completely relaxing, we pulled out the beanbags and watched the sunset while enjoying our charcuterie snacks. Later the night we had the opportunity for stargazing, to top it off, we lit the fire pit and enjoyed the cozy night with some fire-toasted marshmallows from the complimentary s'mores kit. Talk about a greater combo, it was just too perfect.

~ Tip: Once you're up there you are completely solo - only sola power and lantern lights. Being off the grid does mean you won't be able to charge your devices â€” but maybe, with those views, that's not a bad thing. 

~ While we were in Waitomo, we went to see [Marokopa Falls](https://www.waikatonz.com/experiences/walking-hiking-trails/marokopa-falls-waitomo/), it was a lovely stop on our drive around the area, one of the beautiful waterfalls I've seen in NZ, just a 10-minute walk off the road. [Mangapohue Natural Bridge](https://www.waikatonz.com/experiences/walking-hiking-trails/mangapohue-natural-bridge-waitomo/) is another easy walk we did, to an ancient cave system, a must-see as well.

[Waitomo glowworm caves](https://www.waitomo.com/glowworms-and-caves/waitomo-glowworm-caves), [The Lost World](https://www.waitomo.co.nz/adventure/lost-world-epic-all-day-adventure) are other great things to do around the area, though we didn't have time to do. Hopefully next time. 

If you're ever planning to go to this place, I highly recommend it. :) \
Enjoy this small clip of our stay.

If you're a nature-lover at heart and enjoy camping but want to treat yourself a little extra on your special day, then glamping is your luxury medium.\
\
By its very name, the concept of *Glamping* is a fusion of glamor + camping where stunning nature meets modern luxury. Once in a while, it's nice to go somewhere (hassle-free) without having to think of packing or setting up your camp.

If you're looking for a unique hideaway to unwind and unplug from the world, enjoy breathtaking panoramic views, and experience the peaceful New Zealand Countryside, then [Waitomo Hilltop Glamping](https://www.waitomoglamping.nz/) is the SPOT! 

Super pleased that we picked the right spot to celebrate my birthday and our first-ever glamping experience. Everything was magical and beyond what we imagined. Here are some highlights & tips for our stay.\
\
~ Only a two and half hour drive from Auckland, this goregeous place is set on a 700-hectare farm on the crest of a hill with views in every direction. The road to the tent is a little wild walk but its all worth it once you reach to the top, trust me.  

~ The one I was most excited for and probably the hightlight of our stay, dual outdoor bathtubs sitting on the ledge. Talk about bathing with a view and soaking up the sunrise with overlooking fog hills in the morning, Ah, I'll never forget this view. I hope this picture do the justice :) 

~ This safari tent has all the essentials you need and its hard to see it getting more lux than this. It has super comfy queen size bed (also, 2 x small beds for additional guests), an ensuite bathroom with flushing toilet, shower & eco-friendly toiletries. 

~ Love their outdoor kitchen & pizza oven! We stayed here for one night, so we bought our own food and stucked to our charcuterie snacks and pizza, also you have an option to catering, just let them know before hand. They complimented us with farm fresh eggs, a fresh loaf of homemade bread, butter and milk which was way more than enough for our next day breakky. 

~ A s'mores kit + Firepit to cozy up on cold nights. Talk about a greater combo!





* Gumboots or walking shoes if you want to do a farm walk
* No electricity up in the tent, so make sure you charge your devices
* Stargazing opportunities. hint: Grab some beanbags
* Therapeutic massages are available 
* Marokopa Falls was a lovely stop on our drive around the area, A beautiful waterfall just a 10- minute walk off the road.
* Waitomo Glowworm Caves

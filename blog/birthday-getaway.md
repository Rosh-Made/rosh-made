If you're a nature-lover at heart and enjoy camping but want to treat yourself a little extra on your special day, then glamping is your luxury medium.\
\
By its very name, the concept of *Glamping* is a fusion of glamor + camping where stunning nature meets modern luxury. Once in a while, it's nice to go somewhere (hassle-free) without having to think of packing and setting up your camp.

If you're looking for a unique hideaway to unwind and unplug from the world, enjoy breathtaking panoramic views, and experience the peaceful New Zealand Countryside, then [Waitomo Hilltop Glamping](https://www.waitomoglamping.nz/) is a another SPOT! 

Super pleased that we picked the right spot to celebrate my birthday and our first-ever glamping experience. Everything was magical and beyond what we imagined. Here are some highlights & tips for our stay.\
\
~ Only a two and half hour drive from Auckland, this goregeous place is set on a 700-hectare farm on the crest of a hill with views in every direction. The road to the tent is a little wild walk but its all worth it once you reach to the top, trust me! 

~ The one I was most excited for and probably the hightlight of our stay, dual outdoor bathtubs sitting on the ledge. Talk about bathing with a view and soaking up the sunrise with overlooking fog hills in the morning, Ah, I'll never forget this view. I hope this picture do the justice :) 

~ This safari tent has all the essentials you need and its hard to see it getting more lux than this. The tent has super comfy queen size bed (also, 2 x small beds for additional guests), an ensuite bathroom with flushing toilet, shower & eco-friendly toiletries. 

~ Love their outdoor kitchen & pizza oven! We stayed here for one night, so we bought our own food and stucked to our charcuterie snacks and pizza, also you have an option to catering, just let them know before hand. They complimented us with farm fresh eggs, a fresh loaf of homemade bread, butter and milk which was way more than enough for our next day breakky. 

~ Another hightlight of our stay was watching the sunset which was absolutely breathtaking and completely relaxing, we pulled out the beanbags and watched the sunset. Later the night we had the opportunity for a stargazing, to top it off, they complimented us with a s'mores kit. We lit the firepit and enjoyed the cozy nightout, talk about a greater combo, it was just too perfect. 

~ Tips: Once you're up there you are completely solo - only sola power and lantern lights, make sure you charge your devices. 

~ While we were in Waitomo, we went to see [Marokopa Falls](https://www.waikatonz.com/experiences/walking-hiking-trails/marokopa-falls-waitomo/), it was a lovely stop on our drive around the area, one of the beautiful waterfalls I've seen in NZ, just a 10-minute walk off the road. [Mangapohue Natural Bridge](https://www.waikatonz.com/experiences/walking-hiking-trails/mangapohue-natural-bridge-waitomo/) is another easy walk we did, to an ancient cave system, a must see as well. 

\
[Waitomo glowworm caves](https://www.waitomo.com/glowworms-and-caves/waitomo-glowworm-caves), [The Lost World](https://www.waitomo.co.nz/adventure/lost-world-epic-all-day-adventure) are some great things to do around the area, though we didn't had time to do. Hopfully next time. :) 

Enjoy this small clip of our stay :)

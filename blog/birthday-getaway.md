If you're a nature-lover at heart and enjoy camping but want to treat yourself a little extra on your special day, then glamping is your luxury medium.\
\
By its very name, the concept of *Glamping* is a fusion of glamor + camping where stunning nature meets modern luxury. Once in a while, it's nice to go somewhere hassle-free without having to think of packing or setting up your camp.

If you're looking for a unique hideaway to unwind and unplug from the world, enjoy breathtaking panoramic views, and experience the peaceful New Zealand Countryside, then [Waitomo Hilltop Glamping](https://www.waitomoglamping.nz/) is the SPOT! 

We are so pleased we picked the right spot for our first-ever glamping experience, everything was magical and beyond what we imagined. Here are some highlights & tips for our stay.

This beautiful place is set on a 700-hectare farm on the crest of a hill, around a three-hour drive from Auckland (A short drive from the famous Waitomo Caves)

Waitomo Hilltop Glamping is a getaway in one large custom canvas safari tentâ€” but with all the luxuries of a high-end hotel. 

* This is what I was super excited for, dual outdoor bathtubs to soak up the overlooking hills ;) 

  a fully equipped en suite (with twin basins so you can even social distance from your partner) a range of eco toiletries, glorious bedding, Egyptian towels, and you are within spitting distance of Mother Nature herself. 





Enjoy this small clip of our stay :)

What’s come to your mind when you think about flowers, plants, and trees?
Yes, they are beautiful, delicate, bring a splash of colors to the garden, and perfect for attracting beautiful insects. 

But hey! they also play a vital role in the functioning of our ecosystems. This is especially true in the case of pollinators. In Simple, the functioning of our ecosystem rests on the tiny backs of these pollinators – a big burden for their little shoulders to bear! 

**Science:**

This amazing wildlife moves from plant to plant while searching for protein-rich pollen aka high-energy nectar to eat. As they go, they are dusted by pollen and move it to the next flower, fertilizing the plant and allowing it to reproduce and form seeds, berries, fruits, and other plant foods that form the foundation of the food chain for other species—including humans. In fact, we rely on pollinators to help produce as much as one-third of our food.

Here's a little art that explains pollination.

Current Issue
Pollinators are in trouble and are dropping at a terrifying rate worldwide. These little workers are so essential for our natural world, and they are more important than ever.
Bees are the most important pollinators, including butterflies, moths, wasps, flies, and beetle.
Reasons 
Habitat loss, invasive species, parasites, and pesticides are largely to blame.

Hints: 
You don’t need a big backyard, what you have is more than enough. 
I’d suggest you buy plants if you’re a beginner, but also you can try to sow seeds. 
You don’t have to start big, just start with a couple, and see how it goes. This is my second year planting, so I’m going big this time ;) 
They need water just like other species, so keep water for them.
•	Use social media for the better! 
Spread the word among your friends and family, use your social media to share how important it is to grow plants, and your amazing progress.  

•	A great summer project for kids
An educational + fun project to do with the kids. Start with swan plants, sunflower seeds…

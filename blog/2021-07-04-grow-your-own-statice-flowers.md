Statice flowers are vivid Mediterranean imports that have found favor with florists, crafters, and home gardeners alike who appreciate the showy, long-lasting bracts. You won’t find statice plants in many nurseries, but the seeds are cheap and sprout readily even for those with brownish thumbs. Due to its funky, musty odor, you won’t want to bury your nose in a statice bouquet, but you will find the rugged plants a pleasing addition to rock gardens or seaside landscapes.

BLOG PURPOSE: 

How to grow ever-lasting vibrant and paper-textured statice flowers in your home garden. 

![](/assets/img_4814.jpg)

REASON: 

I'm a flower girl, they make me the happiest, are we relatable ? ;) 

I buy fresh cut flowers every month mostly during summer. But boy oh boy they can be crazy expensive, Statice, Sunflowers, Eucalyptus (it's foliage) are a few of my favourites but in that naughty expensive list. If I'm not mistaken 10 stem bunches of statice is 40 bucks (NZ). Say what! 

This is when it hit me why not try growing them in my garden. hmm.

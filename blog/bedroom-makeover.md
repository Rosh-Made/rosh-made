For someone who has the heart and soul for interior design, Renovating & Styling our very first home was honestly a dream come true. 

One of my favorite renovation projects in the house was redoing our bedroom. I feel like it's one of the most important rooms in a house, not because you spend one-third of your whole life sleeping; but simply it's a place to relax away from the world. 

Given how much time we spend in this room, despite being essentially unconscious for most of it, it was so important for us to have a well-organized, relaxing, and minimal-looking space. 

Are you looking for some ideas to create your dream bedroom?  Soon I will share some amazing design tips and our experience of the whole renovation process. Stay around!
